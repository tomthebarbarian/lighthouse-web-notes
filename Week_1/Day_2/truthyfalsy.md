# Truthy falsy type coercion

double vs trip equals

==,===

== attempts to coerce

=== tests types too

!= and !== follow similar themes.

keep in mind that truthy/falsey values are not actually equivalent to true/false

0 == false
but not 0 === false


how do we use truthy/falsey then?
Mainly to check if our strs and []s are empty or not
